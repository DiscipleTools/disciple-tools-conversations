# Disciple.Tools - Disciple.Tools Conversations

This plugin adds the "conversations" record type to Disciple.Tools.
Conversations are tracked on a conversation, be it emails, sms messages, WhatsApp messages, Facebook Messages.

## Purpose

This plugin helps keep track on what channel a conversation is happening on. 
It provides a way to track extra information like GDPR consent, newsletter opt-ins, conversation status and more.
It also the plate to send message to a contact from the Disciple.Tools interface.

Each conversation is unique, which means no 2 conversations track the same email message or phone number.

## Security

Mimicking contacts permissions. A User with access to all contacts can access all conversations
A multiplier only has access to the conversations that they create or that are shared with them.
If multiplier adds an emails or phone that already has a conversations attached to it, they don't automatically get access to the conversation.
